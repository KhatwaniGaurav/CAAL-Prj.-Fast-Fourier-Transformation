# CAAL-Prj.-Fast-Fourier-Transformation
A recursive implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using butterfly operations, bit-reversal ordering, and twiddle factors for efficient frequency domain analysis. Optimized for radix-2 inputs with complex number support and O(n log n) performance.
